            This web application offers users a platform for managing and sharing their favorite recipes. Project provides a user-friendly and intuitive interface to create, update, and organize culinary creations.
        </p>
        <h4>Technology Used</h4>
            <p>The Recipe Book application utilizes the following technologies:</p>
            <ul>

            <li><span>Frontend:</span> React JS, react-router, axios, react-hook-form.</li>
            <li><span>Backend:</span> Node JS, Express, jsonwebtoken, mongoose, cors.</li>
            <li><span>Database:</span> MongoDB.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Purpose</h4>
        <p>
          The idea for this project came to me when I realized that I needed a
          place to store all the recipes I found online. While there are apps
          available that offer such functionality, I found that I wasn't
          satisfied with their recipe creation forms. They all had strict rules
          about how recipes should be organized in order to be added. 
          <p>So, I
          decided to create my own recipe book. It has a user-friendly edit form
          that doesn't require users to follow strict rules about how to create
          their recipe. Additionally, users can upload the URL to an image of
          their dish or simply select a stock image of the prepared recipe.</p> 
          <p>This
          web app utilizes client-side routing, implemented with react-router,
          allowing users to seamlessly transition between pages. Users can also
          like recipes from others, and these liked recipes will be displayed on
          their individual profile page.</p>
        </p>
        <h4>Features</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span>Recipe Management:</span> Registered users can create, update,
            and delete their own recipes through a user-friendly edit form.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>User Authentication:</span> Users can register accounts and
            log in securely using JWT Tokens.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Add image:</span> Users can add URL to the trird-party website
            that hosts their image of dish or similar to it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Favorite Recipes:</span> Users can add recipes created by
            others to their favorites for easy access.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Seacrh functionality:</span> Users can search for recipes by
            dish name, making it easy to find specific recipes.
          </li>

        <h4>Current Status</h4>
        <p>
          The current status of the project is in development. However, two
          significant security issues have been identified in the web
          application:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The authentication system utilizes local storage, which can be
          easily manipulated by anyone, potentially granting unauthorized access
          to the backend server. A solution to this issue would involve
          revamping the entire system to use session cookies or integrating a
          third-party authentication provider.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The insertion of URLs for images does not include validation to
          verify the legitimacy of the inserted link. This leaves the
          application vulnerable to malicious JavaScript code injection, which
          could potentially compromise the security of the entire app. To
          address this issue, I am currently developing a server where users can
          upload images directly, and the server will store these images in a
          third-party cloud provider.
