          The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can
          select from various sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Merge
          Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort. Upon selection, the chosen algorithm
          is visually represented on an array of elements to be sorted.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the sorting process unfolds, the application dynamically updates
          the visualization in real-time, allowing users to observe each step of
          the algorithm's execution. Additionally, users can control the speed
          of the animation to better understand the intricacies of each sorting
          algorithm's behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project was crafted entirely from scratch, using React JS for the
          frontend interface and incorporating refactored sorting functions
          sourced from reputable web sources. This hands-on approach not only
          ensured a deeper understanding of the algorithms but also allowed for
          tailored integration within the application's architecture, resulting
          in a seamless and efficient sorting visualization.

        <h4>Purpose</h4>
        <p>
          The purpose of the Sorting Algorithms Visualizer project is to create
          an interactive and educational tool for exploring various sorting
          algorithms in action. By providing real-time visualizations of sorting
          processes, the project aims to enhance understanding and appreciation
          of fundamental algorithms used in computer science. It serves as a
          platform to experiment with different algorithms, observe their
          behavior, and gain insights into their performance characteristics.
        </p>
        <h4>Features</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span>"Generate New Array" Button:</span> Upon clicking this button,
            a new row of vertical bars with varying heights is generated. These
            bars represent the elements of an array, which will then be sorted
            using the chosen algorithm.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Animation Control:</span> During the visualization process,
            all other functionality is disabled to focus on the sorting
            animation. Once the animation stops, sorting buttons remain inactive
            until a new array is generated, ensuring a smooth and uninterrupted
            user experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Speed Adjustment:</span> Users can adjust the speed of the
            sorting process using a speed slider. This allows for customization
            of the animation speed according to individual preferences,
            facilitating a tailored and interactive learning experience.

        <h4>Leasons Learned</h4>
        <p>
          React DOM tends to collect all changes before updating, which is great
          for efficiency but bad for the main purpose of this project. The
          solution that I came up with was using the setTimeOut functionality to
          give React time to update DOM and show changes in the array. I rewrote
          some sorting algorithms to collect all changes that were made at each
          step of sorting and then animated them.
        </p>

        <p>
          During working on this project I learned how to correctly update state
          of different components depending on the stage of process.
        </p>
        <h4>Drawbacks</h4>
        <p>
          One of the big drawbacks of this web application is that it is not
          designed to be responsive because the vertical bars used to visually
          represent the sorting process need to be of sufficient height and
          quantity, which may not scale effectively on smaller screens.
