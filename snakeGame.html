          The project is a browser-based Snake Game implemented using Vanilla
          JavaScript and HTML Canvas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Players control a snake navigating through a retro-inspired
          environment, consuming food to grow longer while avoiding collisions
          with obstacles and the snake's own tail.
        </p>
        <p>
          With responsive controls and dynamic rendering, the game provides a
          classic arcade experience directly in the web browser, complete with
          immersive sound effects and background music to enhance the gameplay
          atmosphere.

        <h4>Purpose</h4>
        <p>
          I created this project during my learning of HTML5 Canvas. Initially,
          it consisted solely of a canvas element on a white background, with a
          snake moving inside a rectangular box. As development progressed, I
          decided to enhance its visual appeal by adding a background image to
          simulate an old arcade gaming station. Additionally, being a
          passionate gamer myself, I incorporated ambient soundtracks and sound
          effects to infuse the game with more fun and excitement.
        </p>
        <h4>Features</h4>
        <ul class="dots">

        <h4>Leasons Learned</h4>
        <p>
          During development, I encountered a couple of challenges along the
          way. One notable issue arose from the disparity in display
          characteristics, particularly with Apple products featuring Retina
          displays. The higher pixel density led to blurry rendering of elements
          drawn on the Canvas. To address this, I implemented a solution that
          involved adjusting the Canvas dimensions based on the display ratio,
          resulting in crisper visuals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another problem I faced was the restrictions imposed by the Chrome
          Browser regarding background sounds. By default, Chrome prevents
          background sounds from playing automatically unless the user interacts
          with the page or until another sound is triggered. To bypass this
          limitation, I devised a workaround by incorporating a brief silence
          sound at the onset, effectively prompting the browser to unblock
          subsequent sound playback.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, these challenges presented valuable learning opportunities,
          reinforcing my problem-solving skills and deepening my understanding
          of web development intricacies.
